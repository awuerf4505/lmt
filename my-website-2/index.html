        <h2>What is Last Minute Trips?</h2>
        <p>
          Last Minute Trips is an original web series created by popular vloggers (video bloggers) Julien Solomita and Collin Duddy. Having a successful experience on YouTube with over 1 million subscribers, Solomita is known for his <a class="img "href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheFightingSolo">vlogging channel</a> where he documents his life and production processes. Through his connections with YouTube media, Solomita and Duddy met and started to come up with ideas for a video project. These two creators have partnered through their production company <a class="img" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClG73LbaSrUjPDmARxYWl8Q">Waffsicle</a> to create the new series. Even though the series is still pretty new, Last Minute Trips brings a whole new meaning to travel vlogging.

        <h3>Why is this so special?</h3>
          <p>
            If you have ever tried to decide on a vacation destination, you know how hard it is to choose between locations. In Last Minute Trips, the choosing is done by two darts and a map. Julien and Collin throw darts at a map of the United States while blindfolded. Usually while livestreaming on YouTube, they each throw one dart at the map and both darts land on points that are usually small towns. They then head to social media polls to let their fans decide which place the Waffsicle duo should explore. After the final tally is in and the pair knows where they are going, they leave usually the same day on a last minute flight and the adventure begins.
